Accessing memory

An important difference in kernel programming is how to access and allocate memory. Due to the fact that kernel programming is very close to the physical machine, there are important rules for memory management. First, it works with several types of memory:

        Physical memory
        Virtual memory from the kernel address space
        Virtual memory from a process's address space
        Resident memory - we know for sure that the accessed pages are present in physical memory
